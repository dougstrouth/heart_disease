    "# Heart Disease Dataset Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "This synthetic dataset contains clinical and lifestyle attributes for individuals, with a binary target indicating the presence of heart disease. Each row represents one individual (patient record). The data appear numeric and categorical-encoded, suitable for classification tasks such as predicting heart disease risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "## High-level Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rows (records):** Each record corresponds to a single patient.\n",
    "- **Columns (features):** Mix of demographic, clinical, test results, and lifestyle indicators.\n",
    "- **Target:** `heart_disease` (0 = no heart disease, 1 = heart disease).\n",
    "- **Typical uses:**\n",
    "    - Supervised learning for risk prediction (classification).\n",
    "    - Exploratory data analysis of cardiovascular risk factors.\n",
    "    - Feature importance and model interpretability research.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Column Dictionary\n",
